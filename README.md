# 🇮🇳 Indian Economy Analysis
A comprehensive macroeconomic analysis of India using data science tools. This project explores the relationships between various economic indicators and critically examines classical economic models in the Indian context.

## 📚 Data Sources
The data used in this project has been sourced from credible Indian government and international websites, including:
- MOSPI (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation)
- RBI (Reserve Bank of India)
- World Bank Open Data
- Trading Economics
- UNData

## 🎯 Aim
To evaluate the Indian economy using key macroeconomic variables and assess the relevance of classical economic theories such as Okun's Law, Phillips Curve, and the relationship between GDP and inflation in the Indian context.

## ✅ Objectives
- Collect and clean macroeconomic data relevant to India.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on selected indicators.
- Visualize trends and correlations using Python.
- Evaluate the applicability of macroeconomic models.
- Derive actionable economic insights from the data.

🧾 Dataset Columns
The analysis involves the following economic indicators:
- year
- population
- inflation
- gdp_per_capita
- gdp_growth_rate
- unemployment
- life_expectancy
- trade_balance

- lending_interest
- gov_debt
- fdi_inflows
- fdi_outflows
- labour_force_participation
- external_balance_of_goods_and_services
- current_acc_balance
- exchange_rates
- fiscal_data
Each column represents time-series data for the Indian economy over multiple years.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

📌 Key Insights
- GDP per capita is strongly correlated with life expectancy, exchange rates, and fiscal indicators.
- Lending interest rates show strong negative correlations with multiple development metrics.
- Inflation is weakly correlated with most other indicators, suggesting complexity in policy outcomes.
- Classical models such as Okun’s Law and Phillips Curve have limited predictive power in India.

## 🧠 Theoretical Background
### 🔸 Okun’s Law
A macroeconomic theory that postulates an inverse relationship between unemployment and GDP growth. If GDP rises, unemployment falls.
Finding: The relationship is weak in India, possibly due to structural unemployment and informal labor.

### 🔸 Phillips Curve
Suggests an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.
Finding: This trade-off is not clearly observed in India’s data, indicating influence from supply-side and external factors.

### 🔸 GDP vs Inflation
Typically, moderate inflation is considered a byproduct of a growing economy, especially demand-pull inflation.
Finding: In India, inflation and GDP show weak to no correlation, hinting at non-demand factors like cost-push inflation and fiscal inefficiencies.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project provides a quantitative lens to understand India's economic dynamics. The findings reveal that while some classical theories hold ground in certain periods, India’s economic landscape is nuanced and driven by multiple, often non-linear, forces. Further analysis using machine learning or longer datasets could yield even deeper insights.
