# Indian_Economy_Analysis

ABSTRACT 

 

This research paper entails macroeconomic analysis of India’s growing economy. The analysis focuses on India’s financial performance from 1991 to 2023. Additionally, based on the macroeconomic Key Performance Indicators (GDP per capita, Credit Growth, Consumer Price Index and Unemployment Rate) we check for the validity and applicability of key empirical economic models (Okun’s Law and Phillips Curve) and theoretical frameworks (Aggregate Supply SRAS & LRAS curve). The KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) are also used to understand structural evolution of India’s economic trajectory. Findings of the statistical analysis and trend examination indicates that Indian economy partially adheres to these empirical and theoretical models. This analysis also contributes to understanding the working and interaction of real-world data in a developing economy, offering insights for policy formulation and future research. 

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

India, the fourth largest and the fastest-growing economy in the world, has experienced significant macroeconomic shifts since 1991. These shifts were marked by liberalization, globalization, structural reforms and pandemic, which has made it difficult to understand India’s financial trajectory. Over the years, India has introduced various structural reforms to reshape the economic landscape with the introduction of Goods and Service Tax (GST), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and financial sector adjustments. These long-term shifts were periodically disrupted by external factors or shocks, like the 2003 international oil crisis, 2008 global financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, all of which exposed India’s vulnerabilities and has a significant effect on the country’s inflation, unemployment and growth.  

Now, understanding these key indicators – GDP, inflation, unemployment and growth, lead us to understanding a country at a macroeconomic level. To use these indicators and derive valuable insights can be accomplished using the empirical (Okun’s Law, Phillips Curve) and theoretical (Aggregate Supply SRAS and LRAS curve) models. However, these models are often developed and validated in the context of advanced economies like United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK), which are developed countries. Therefore, these theories and models may not be directly applicable to India, being a developing country. 

This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of trends in Indian economy over the past three decades (1991 to 2023), while also evaluating and validating the empirical and theoretical models. To support this analysis, the study employs Python for data preprocessing and visualizations. The findings are then intended to provide insights on the necessity of adapting and developing an empirical model that better reflects India’s macroeconomic trends, thereby informing both academic research and policy making.
